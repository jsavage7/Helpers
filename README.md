# Helpers
The helpers library is a library of common tasks when dealing with SQL/ Text files.

This includes:

1. File Helpers 
  - Reading from files
  - Writing to a file using a list of strings
  - Checking if a file/ directory exists based on a full file path and creating it if it doesn't exist
2. Text Helpers
  - Checking if text matches (Case sensitive/ not sensitive)
  - Regex Replace
  - Checking if an email is valid
  - Converting a string list to a CSV file
3. XML Helpers
  - These helpers are used to query the XML using XPath. EvaluateXPath will allow functions to run such as sum().
4. Sql Helpers
  - These are used to connect to SQL to insert data, update data, and to retreive a dataset/ data.
